        <h2>What is recycled wastewater</h2>
        <p>Wastewater is the used water from homes and businesses that is collected through the sewerage network. Wastewater is 99.97 per cent water (from showers, baths and washing machines) and the remainder is dissolved and suspended matter. In most major towns in WA this water is collected by utilities, such as the Water Corporation, is treated and cleaned, then disposed of. 
        This water can be disposed of in a variety of ways including</p>

        <p>• Ocean discharge</p>
        <p>• Environmental discharge to waterways or wetlands, or</p>
        <p>• Water recycling, where it’s re-used as a water source for non-potable (drinking water) purposes rather than being treated as a waste product. </p>

        <br class="clearfloat"/>
        
        <p>Recycled water can be used on a variety of different land uses. They can generally be classed as</p>
        <p>• Extra low risk (e.g. woodlots)</p>
        <p>• Low risk (e.g. recreational open space irrigation, fodder production, wetland recharge)</p>
        <p>• Medium or High risk (e.g. food crops, animal watering, in-house use)</p>

        <p>Further treatment may be required, depending on the intended use, if treated wastewater is considered as a non-drinking water source option.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of using recycled water</h2>

        <p>Recycled water has a variety of benefits including</p>
        <p>• Supplementing your water supply, potentially reducing your local demand for potable water</p>
        <p>• Providing a climate resilient water source</p>
        <p>• Reusing nutrients for plant growth that would otherwise go to landfill or the environment</p>
        <p>• Building new industries that promote community resilience or jobs, such as agriculture</p>
        <p>• Greening community open spaces</p>

      <h2>Considerations for setting up a reuse scheme</h2>

      <p>As outlined by the Department of Water, the viability of a wastewater reuse system will depend on factors including:</p>
      <p>• wastewater volume and quality availability</p>
      <p>• intended uses, estimated demand and back-up (contingency) water source</p>
      <p>• required level of treatment for intended uses</p>
      <p>• management of health and environmental risks</p>
      <p>• site limitations, including proximity to public drinking water source areas or sensitive environmental areas</p>
      <p>• land requirements for infrastructure and storage (below or above ground)</p>
      <p>• cost of implementation and ongoing management of the scheme</p>
      <p>• governance issues surrounding long-term ownership, operation and management</p>
      <p>• community awareness and acceptance</p>
      <p>• required approvals.</p>

      <h2>Request for access to water</h2>
      <p>Has your land or facility been flagged as a potential reuse site? Would you like to access this recycled waste water, maybe for animal fodder or public open space irrigation? 
    If so then please visit the WA Department of Health’s website (http://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Articles/N_R/Recycled-water) to find out how to manage the water to keep the public safe (Guidelines for the Non-Potable Uses of Recycled Water in Western Australia (PDF 1.6MB)).</p> 
      <p>Application information: http://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Articles/A_E/Application-process-for-approval-of-recycling-water-scheme</p> 
      <p>Maybe make an online application form?</p>


      <h2>Available Grants</h2>
      <p>A variety of grants are available that may assist communities in accessing this water.</p>
